# homework-three315

For this third assignment I did for this class, I created this website called "House Party Music Store Website." Even though "House Party" is actually an NC-17 hysterical comedy PC game, I decided I want to be creative, based on the game itself by creating a music record store website with game characters as managers and employers. Overall, I loosely implemented a website from multiple record store websites such as "Tower Records," "Disruptor Records," "Hollywood Records," "Walt Disney Records," "Universal Music Group," and other record stores or record studios sites.

For what I constructed:

- HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS
- Speaking of JS, I also constructed JQuery and MVC onto the model.js and app.js
- Try to inject all 5 pages
